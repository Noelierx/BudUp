# BudUp!

BudUp! Is the brainchild of team Ctrl, Alt, Compete! Who came together during the Athena Winter Hackathon, November 2021 to solve problems that have stemmed from the rise of remote and hybrid working.

After an initial think-tank, the team decided to solve staff retention and team isolation issues by building a web-app that matches team mates based on interests and skills - to foster a culture of belonging and inclusivity. 

With BudUp! productivity will soar, as newcomers begin to add valuable contributions to teams from day one of the onboarding process.
